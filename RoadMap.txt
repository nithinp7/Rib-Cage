ROADMAP

There are lots of long-term / high-level goals for this project, I will fill those in here after some of the more basic stuff is implemented...

Short-term:
Debug functionality:
- Basic skeleton editor
- Selectable nodes, translation / rotation gizmos, orbital camera, orthographic camera
- Might be useful to have generic selectable nodes buffer + compute pass to generate indirect drawlists
   - e.g., indirect draw lists for gizmos only on selected nodes?
- Need better picking? GPU picking?
- Serializing / deserializing skeleton 

Once all of that is sorted out, can start on some basic IK solvers and procedural animation stuff
Can also use the skeleton editor to specify various spring constraints / motors
