ROADMAP

This is going to remain a loose collection of experiments and features until a coherent game / engine takes
shape

Short-term:
- x scene-to-gbffer phase
- x SceneElement abstraction

gameplay prototype
- rotor animations
- basic flight controller for helicopter
- simple foliage / wind

blocking pipeline work:
- hammer out workflow to export from blender --> Althea
- uv mapping, PBR textures
- ...animations!

blocking systems work:
- rigid body collision detection 
- eventually rigid body physics solver
- generic skinning framework

Future areas to explore:
- procedural animation
- IK solver 
- skeleton / constraint editor
