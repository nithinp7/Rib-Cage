ROADMAP

This is going to remain a disparate collection of experiments and features until a coherent game / engine takes
shape

Short-term:
- gbffer phase
- SceneElement abstraction

Areas to explore:
- procedural animation
- IK solver 
// TODO: Fill out the longer-term goals here

Once all of that is sorted out, can start on some basic IK solvers and procedural animation stuff
Can also use the skeleton editor to specify various spring constraints / motors
